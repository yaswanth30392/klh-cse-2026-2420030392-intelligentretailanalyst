ConsumerIQ: An Explainable AI Framework for Intelligent Customer Analytics
Project Overview
ConsumerIQ is an AI-powered consumer analytics framework designed to analyze customer, transaction, product, demographic, and behavioral data.

Existing consumer analytics research often focuses on individual tasks such as customer segmentation, purchase prediction, churn prediction, customer lifetime value (CLV), or recommendation. ConsumerIQ aims to integrate these analytical tasks into a unified framework and provide explainable and interactive insights.

The system combines Machine Learning, Customer Analytics, Market Basket Analysis, Explainable AI, and Interactive Visualization to transform raw consumer data into actionable insights.

Problem Statement
Modern retail and e-commerce platforms generate large amounts of customer, transaction, product, and behavioral data. However, these data sources are often analyzed separately, making it difficult to obtain a comprehensive understanding of consumer behavior.

Existing approaches generally focus on individual tasks such as:

Customer Segmentation
Purchase Prediction
Churn Prediction
Customer Lifetime Value
Product Recommendation
Therefore, there is a need for an integrated analytics framework that combines multiple consumer data sources, identifies customer and product patterns, predicts important customer behaviors, explains model predictions, and presents the results through interactive visualizations.

Objectives
1. Unified Consumer Analytics
To develop an integrated framework combining customer segmentation, purchase prediction, churn analysis, customer lifetime value estimation, and product recommendation.

2. Multi-Dataset Analysis
To utilize complementary benchmark datasets representing different dimensions of consumer behavior and evaluate the analytics framework across diverse datasets.

3. Consumer Data Integration
To integrate demographic, transactional, product, and behavioral information for comprehensive consumer profiling.

4. Explainable AI
To incorporate Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP and LIME to interpret model predictions and identify important influencing factors.

5. Interactive Decision Support
To develop an interactive dashboard for exploring customer segments, product relationships, purchasing trends, predictions, and model explanations.

6. Model Evaluation
To compare and evaluate multiple machine-learning approaches using appropriate performance and explainability measures.

Research Gaps Addressed
ConsumerIQ is designed to address the following gaps identified from the literature survey.

Gap 1 — Fragmented Analytics
Existing studies often concentrate on one or a few tasks such as:

Segmentation
Purchase Prediction
Churn Prediction
CLV
Recommendation
ConsumerIQ addresses this by developing a unified consumer analytics pipeline.

Gap 2 — Limited Multi-Dataset Integration
Many studies evaluate their approaches using a single dataset or a specific business context.

ConsumerIQ uses complementary benchmark datasets to analyze different dimensions of consumer behavior.

Gap 3 — Limited Explainability
Complex ML/DL models can be difficult for business users to understand.

ConsumerIQ incorporates:

SHAP
LIME
Feature Importance
to explain model predictions.

Gap 4 — Limited Behavioral + Transactional Integration
Consumer information is often analyzed separately.

ConsumerIQ combines:

Demographics + Transactions + Products + Behavioral Data

to create a richer consumer profile.

Gap 5 — Limited Interactive Decision Support
Research results are often presented through static metrics and tables.

ConsumerIQ provides an interactive dashboard where users can explore consumer segments, products, trends, predictions, and influencing factors.
